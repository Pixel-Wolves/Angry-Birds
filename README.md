Angry Birds

Last Updates:
Added web tab title
Fixed slingshot issue
Made the bird respawn at the slingshot

Pending bugfixes:
Fix bird's movement, you can still move it even after you already did your shot
The pigs dissapear out of place (if you look at it well you can see that the dissappearing pig appears a little more to the right and a little more down than it actually is).
